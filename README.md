# Project Recipes App

Hello and welcome to the Recipes App project!

This was the last assignment built by [Trybe](www.betrybe.com) for the Front End Web Development Module. This challenge app was made to test the students skills with all the tools we learned with React (React Router, Redux, Context API and others). This is also where I put my leadership skills to the test as I took the Agile Methods to heart and applied their concepts in order to better organize my team and write quality code.

As per the time of this current commit, this is the project I'm most proud of!

### The Assignment

*You will develop a recipe app, using the most modern within the React ecosystem: Hooks and Context API!*

*It should be able to see, search, filter, favorite and follow the process of preparing recipes and drinks!*

*The database will have 2 different APIs, one for food and one for drinks.*

*The layout focuses on mobile devices, so all prototypes will be developed on smaller screens.*

### SKills to be Tested

In this project, I was able to:

- Use Redux to manage states;
- Use the React-Redux library;
- Use React's Context API to manage states;
- Use React's Hook useStateUtilizar o React Hook useState
- Use React's Hook useContext;
